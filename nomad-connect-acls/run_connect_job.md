### Create the intention

Consul service mesh starts in "default-deny" mode in datacenters that have ACLs enabled.
You must create an intention to allow traffic from the count-dashboard
service to the count-api service.

Run `consul intention create count-dashboard count-api`{{execute}}

**Example Output**

```screenshot
$ consul intention create count-dashboard count-api
Created: count-dashboard => count-api (allow)
```

### Run the job

Run the job by executing `nomad run countdash.nomad`{{execute}}.

**Example Output**

```screenshot
$ nomad run countdash.nomad
==> Monitoring evaluation "3e7ebb57"
    Evaluation triggered by job "countdash"
    Evaluation within deployment: "9eaf6878"
    Allocation "012eb94f" created: node "c0e8c600", group "api"
    Allocation "02c3a696" created: node "c0e8c600", group "dashboard"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "3e7ebb57" finished with status "complete"
```

Open the Countdash interface by clicking the "Countdash UI" tab above the
terminal. The Countdash interface may appear "Disconnected" on initial load.
Waiting a few seconds or refreshing your browser will update the status to
"Connected".

<div class="alert-info alert">
If the Countdash UI displays "Counting Service is Unreachaable",you should
go back and verify your configuration, and ensure that you have executed all
the guide commandsâ€”specifically the **consul intention create...** command.
</div>

Once you are done, run `nomad stop countdash`{{execute}} to prepare for the next
step.

**Example Output**

```screenshot
$ nomad stop countdash
==> Monitoring evaluation "d4796df1"
    Evaluation triggered by job "countdash"
    Evaluation within deployment: "18b25bb6"
    Evaluation status changed: "pending" -> "complete"
==> Evaluation "d4796df1" finished with status "complete"
```
